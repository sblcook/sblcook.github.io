      <description>I was recently playing around with Sibilant, a language that is stylistically similar to Lisp and compiles to JavaScript, and figured that I would give a brief overview of some of the interesting concepts. There are a whole bunch of languages that compile to JS, and even some others that are also stylistically similar to Lisp like ClojureScript.
Getting started Let&amp;rsquo;s see some example Sibilant code and see how it compiles to get a better understanding of how it works.</description>

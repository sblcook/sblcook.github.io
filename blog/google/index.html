    <h2 id="google-is-big-so-what">Google is big, so what?</h2>
<p>Google and the services/products that they offer have become nearly ubiquitous pieces of modern life. Between emails and video calls, navigation, Android phones, internet searching, and watching videos, one can spend nearly their entire time online using a Google service on Google hardware.</p>
<p>As someone who used to use all of these services, the accuracy of recommmendations can be startling&ndash;from suggested music, videos, and searches to potential restaurants, email compositions, and more. Of course, I can&rsquo;t leave out the most annoying suggestion, the extremely accurate advertisements.</p>
<p>We probably reached this point of digital supremecy held by just a few corporations because their services perform and are designed incredibly well. They don&rsquo;t even cost the consumer any money! But I can&rsquo;t help but think that by having all of our personal data concentrated with just one company we are missing the forest for the trees. I fear that the real costs of this are are far higher than we may initially think.</p>
<p>First, this is a pretty big security risk. If someone who isn&rsquo;t me gets this data, they will know where I work and live, what I buy, what I see, and what I think about. If we diversify our investments, why shouldn&rsquo;t we diversify our most personal information? Sure, maybe it isn&rsquo;t the end of the world if someone targets me, but what if a malicious actor targets a high profile leader or politician? Cyberattacks are a major concern for every country.</p>
<p>Second, Google has a monopoly on a lot internet activity. Monopolies <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/10/americas-monopoly-problem/497549/" title="Monopolies stifle innovation">stifle innovation</a>, but under the current <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Antitrust_Paradox" title="The Antitrust Paradox">&ldquo;consumer welfare&rdquo;</a> standard initially proposed by the late Supreme Court Justice Robert Bork in <em>The Antitrust Paradox</em> and espoused by the Supreme Court today, I do not see much potential for any antitrust actions. This is perhaps a topic for another post, though.</p>
<p>If you still aren&rsquo;t convinced, Google has (somewhat) recently <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/3024190?hl=en" title="Google Instructions on how to download your data">allowed users to download their data</a> that Google has and I highly recommend everyone try it. When I downloaded my information (it took a few days and was over 10GB!), I found out that they had a log of every single purchase made, YouTube video watched, place visited, photo taken, app downloaded, website visited, and much more.</p>
<p>Ultimately, this post is about concrete steps that anyone can take to wrangle back a degree of control from Google. I have listed a few alternatives to many Google products and services. I have used all of them and can recommend them, that is why they are listed. The process is not extremely hard or time consuming, and many changes can be made slowly and incrementally. A few will cost extra €/$, but allow you to have an ad-free experience.</p>

<h3 id="core-services">Core Services</h3>
<p>These are services that are applicable to everyone, including</p>
<h4 id="search">Search</h4>
<p>The big one. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank" title="Page Rank Algorithm">breakthrough</a> that brought Google to where they are today. There are several good alternatives.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://duckduckgo.com/about" title="DuckDuckGo Search">DuckDuckGo</a>: DDG is perhaps the largest of the alternatives to Google Search. They are privacy focused, showing you adverts based on your search terms, not those cute owl videos you were watching yesterday. Recently I have heard a ton of advertisements for them; they must be undergoing a publicity push.</li>
<li><a href="https://info.ecosia.org/about" title="Ecosia Search">Ecosia</a>: Ecosia is a Berlin-based B-Corp that uses moneys generated to plant trees. They are privacy-focused, publish monthly financial reports and tree planting reports, and use Microsoft&rsquo;s Bing. I personally use this and I think that it&rsquo;s really great&ndash;there&rsquo;s even a ticker to see how many trees you personally have planted!.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="email">Email</h4>
<p>Gmail is able to be free partly because every email is scanned to show more accurate adverts. Most alternatives that don&rsquo;t do this will also include calendar and contacts applications that you can uses.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://posteo.de/en" title="Posteo">Posteo</a>: Posteo is a very nice privacy-focused and EU-based email service. You can encrypt emails, and is powered by hydro/wind energy. They are quite
transparent about their business and product. I have used Posteo before and I can highly recommend it. Prices start at a mere €1/month.</li>
<li><a href="https://tutanota.com/" title="Tutanota">Tutanota</a>: Latin for &ldquo;private note&rdquo;, Tutanota is an free and open-source end-to-end encrypted email provider that uses green energy. Honestly comparable to Posteo and they do have their mobile app on <a href="https://www.samcook.dev/blog/google/#android-specific-services">F-Droid</a>. They have a free tier, but the paid tier for individuals is only €1/month.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.zoho.eu/" title="Zoho">Zoho</a>: Zoho offers a variety of business software, including a CRM platform, but has a very nice privacy-focused email option as well.</li>
<li><a href="https://protonmail.com/" title="ProtonMail">ProtonMail</a>: One of the biggest privacy-centric email providers; they also operate <a href="https://protonvpn.com/" title="ProtonVPN">ProtonVPN</a>. The emails have end-to-end encryption, support for PGP, &ldquo;self-destructing&rdquo; messages, and mobile apps. As they are based in Geneva, they follow Swiss data protection laws instead of GDPR. Follows a &ldquo;fremium&rdquo; model with several different tiers; the lowest tier is free but many will want to upgrade to the €5/month tier. App is <strong>not</strong> available on <a href="https://www.samcook.dev/blog/google/#android-specific-services">F-Droid store</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="youtube">Youtube</h4>
<p>Honestly, it&rsquo;s pretty hard to avoid YouTube. It&rsquo;s an entire platform, not something that is easy to switch like your search engine or your email provider. Because of this, if Google were to be broken up, YouTube would probably a discrete entity. Other video hosting platforms like <a href="https://vimeo.com/" title="Vimeo">Vimeo</a> exist and are nice if you would like to upload and share you own videos with family/friends. If there are specific videos or people on YT you want to watch, the best is to create a separate account. Can store it in your password manager.</p>
<h4 id="chrome">Chrome</h4>
<p>Chrome used to be the best browser. It would seem like Firefox has taken that mantle back from Chrome.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/" title="Firefox Browser">Firefox</a>: The browser from Mozilla. A few years ago it was rebuilt and rebranded; it&rsquo;s much faster than it was before the rebuild. It comes with a lot of nice protections built in, but there are still a few lacking. There is a nice mobile app as well. My top recommendation.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.opera.com/" title="Opera Browser">Opera</a>: Interestingly comes with a built in VPN, so all of your traffic is routed through their servers, meaning that your ISP or mobile provider can&rsquo;t see what websites you are visiting. With the end of net neutrality, this is pretty nice. There is a desktop and mobile version.</li>
<li><a href="https://duckduckgo.com/app" title="DuckDuckGo Browser App">DuckDuckGo Browser</a>: Another good option. This is a mobile-only browser. From the Same DDG as <a href="https://www.samcook.dev/blog/google/#general-services/search">above</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/8/21283769/brave-browser-affiliate-links-crypto-privacy-ceo-apology" title="Brave Injects Affiliate Links">Brave</a>: Curious that they&rsquo;re here because I would <strong>not</strong> recommend them. Several weeks ago I absolutely would have, but they were recently <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/8/21283769/brave-browser-affiliate-links-crypto-privacy-ceo-apology" title="Brave Injects Affiliate Links">caught injecting affiliate links</a> to cryptocurrency websites to their users. That&rsquo;s pretty unacceptable.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="maps">Maps</h4>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/about" title="OpenStreetMap">OpenStreeMap</a>: The community-driven and open map software. Works quite well and a pretty cool concept. You can even contribute! There are several clients for both <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Apple_iOS" title="iOS Clients for OSM">iOS</a> and <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Android" title="Android Clients for OSM">Android</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Maps" title="Apple Maps">Apple Maps</a>: The Apple Maps app&ndash;default on every iPhone and Macintosh. Works well and is integrated into Apple Products well. Also used by DuckDuckGo for search results.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="translate">Translate</h4>
<p>A bit nicer than a standard dictionary as it allows you be a bit lazy and will translate entire phrases(or websites!).</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https;//www.deepl.com/translator" title="DeepL">DeepL</a>: Honestly I get better results from DeepL than from Google. They have fewer languages than Google, though. They also have a nice dictionary, Linguee.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="google-docssheetsslides">Google Docs/Sheets/Slides</h4>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.libreoffice.org/" title="Libre Office">Libre Office</a> The Free and Open Source Software alternative office suite. It runs on Linux/Windows/OSX and has a wide range of compatible file formats. It&rsquo;s highly recommendable. The only product that has support for multiple users is the spreadsheet software, Calc, so it is admittedly less convenient than the Google suite if you need to collaborate remotely and in realtime.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="photos">Photos</h4>
<p>I used to use Google Photos to back up my photos in case I was unable to get them from my phone for any reason. I ended up buying a cloud backup software so that I could backup my computer in addition to my entire phone.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.backblaze.com/" title="Backblaze">Backblaze</a>: Recommended by Wirecutter. Has a cool file history feature. As software and disk space both cost money, prices from $6/month. Backs up a single computer.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.idrive.com/" title="IDrive">IDrive</a>: Wirecutter&rsquo;s runner up. Allows multiple devices to back up, but costs a bit more and limits file versioning. You can find a discount for the first year sign up.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="google-drive">Google Drive</h4>
<p>The 21st century thumb drive. In theory one could always revert back to thumb drives but that would defeat the point, I suppose. I just ended up using my cloud backup software.</p>
<h4 id="google-play-music">Google Play Music</h4>
<p>For users of Google&rsquo;s music streaming service, there are plenty of high-profile alternatives&ndash; including several others that I didn&rsquo;t list.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-music/" title="Apple Music">Apple Music</a>: The paid offering from Apple. Integrates well with Apple products, less so with Windows/Android/Linux. The cost is €/$10 monthly, but family and student plans exist.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.spotify.com" title="Spotify">Spotify</a>: The Swedish streaming pioneer needs no introduction. Designed as a quasi social network so your listening history is public. I would recommend used a different email from everything else and definitely <strong>not</strong> linking something like a Facebook account. Same pricing structure as Apple Music.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="meetduohangoutschat">Meet/Duo/Hangouts/Chat</h4>
<p>There is a dizzying array of messaging and calling options from Google that seem to be recycled every two years.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.signal.org" title="Signal Messaging">Signal</a>: The premier privacy-focused messaging and encryption pioneers with end-to-end encryption, video and voice calling, groups, and more. Totally free.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="android-specific-services">Android Specific Services</h3>
<h4 id="app-store">App Store</h4>
<p>How to replace the Google Play App Store? It&rsquo;s impossible, no? Turns out that there is a very nice alternative that does not involve downloading APK&rsquo;s from shady websites.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://f-droid.org/" title="F-Droid app store">F-Droid</a>: F-Droid is an alternative app store for FOSS software. You can install/uninstall/update software from it. There are a lot of apps, although truthfully the selection is far slimmer than the Google store.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="miscellaneous-actions">Miscellaneous Actions</h4>
<p>I would suggest turning off location data for <em>every</em> app that you have and then only turning it on for the apps where you really need it. Aditionally, I would recommend turning off &ldquo;Google Location Accuracy&rdquo;. This is where your phone uses Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connections that are available to you phone to pinpoint your location (Google collected this data while their cars drove around taking photos for Streetview).</p>
<h3 id="home-automation">Home Automation</h3>
<h4 id="nest-doorbellthermostatcameralock">Nest Doorbell/Thermostat/Camera/Lock</h4>
<p>Honestly, a lot of home automation software that is connected to the internet freaks me out. It is <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3273929/voice-squatting-attacks-hacks-turn-amazon-alexa-google-home-into-secret-eavesdroppers.html">susceptible to hacking</a> and attacks, and in general I don&rsquo;t think it provides that much advantage. Do you really want your <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/news/hacker-accesses-ring-camera-in-little-girls-bedroom-to-tell-her-hes-santa/" title="Creepy Ring">kids to be able to be spied on by some random hacker</a> or your thermostat to know exactly when you are or are not home to find the best time for a <a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/us/nest-spying-hack,news-19290.html">burglary</a>? If you insist on some home automation software, I would recommend using something air-gapped from the internet.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/" title="Home Asssistant">Home Assistant</a>: Home Assistant is a nice, open-source, platform that you can use to create your own home automation devices with Raspberry Pi(s).</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="google-homeassistant">Google Home/Assistant</h4>
<p>For Google Home/Assistant to work, it is <em>always listening</em>. Of course, anyone who is in the room with you can use your account <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3137187/google-home-glaring-flaw.html">as if they were you</a>&ndash;reading emails, events, etc. But wait&ndash;it&rsquo;s even possible to shine a laser from hundreds of meters at the microphone to give specific commands like &ldquo;open the garage door&rdquo;! <a href="https://lightcommands.com/" title="Light Commands">Seriously</a>! Sure, you could unplug it when you don&rsquo;t want to use it, but isn&rsquo;t the entire point that it is super easy to use? If I need to reach to plug it in then I might as well just put on <em>Walk Like an Egyptian</em> myself.</p>
<h3 id="hardware">Hardware</h3>
<h4 id="chromebook">Chromebook</h4>
<p>Chromebooks are a nice concept. Not super powerful computers, but many people just need a Facebook/email/internet machine. However, with a Chromebook, you are locked in to the Google ecosystem.</p>
<ul>
<li>Linux on an old laptop: There is a lot of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_open-source_computing_hardware" title="FOSS Hardware">cool, open-source hardware</a>, but an easy suggestion is to just install a lightweight Linux distribution on an old business laptop. Things like Lenovo ThinkPads are nearly indestructible!</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="miscellaneous">Miscellaneous</h3>
<h4 id="domain-hosting">Domain Hosting</h4>
<p>If you want to have your own domain for a site or email, you will need a domain registrar.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.namecheap.com/" title="Namecheap">Namecheap</a>: Namecheap has good service, competitive prices, and has recently started offering other cool services, like email hosting.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="google-analytics">Google Analytics</h4>
<p>I am still learning about this, but I will link this <a href="https://lwn.net/SubscriberLink/822568/61d29096a4012e06/">article from LWN.net</a>.</p>
<h3 id="things-that-im-still-looking-for-a-good-replacement">Things that I&rsquo;m still looking for a good replacement</h3>
<h4 id="google-voice">Google Voice</h4>
<p>This is a pretty cool VOIP service to which you can port your phone number and use for calling/SMS.</p>
<h4 id="chromecast">Chromecast</h4>
<p>Sometimes you just want to show a funny cat video on the big screen, you know?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll try to update this list as I think of more or learn of more resources.</p>
